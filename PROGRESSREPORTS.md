# Progress Reports

### 24/05/25 (ver 1.0.0)
- After about 4 hours I finally got the github to work! I added a progress reports, change log and readme alongside all the header and source files
- Since the project is still very bare bones I'll focus more on building it out before diving into github again
- Aim to do 3-8 hours a week on this since I just started some CS50 courses which I'm making the higher priority

### Begining state of Project
- Just started rewriting my origin program into a file system which is new to me
- Started refactoring all the major systems into Classes for easier use as the project expands
- Have transitioned most of the basic functions into their respective files and made some minor improvements for scalability but almost none of the old objects have been added yet
- Hope to build a large strategic game and then transition it to a GUI system
